### info

- `ANTLR 4.7.1` is used for both grammar and test program. the `ANTLR 4.7.1` jar file exists in the `lib` folder.
- test programs does not contain errorful programs. all should pass. I hope :)
- antlr4.antlrToolPath=<PATH TO PROJECT>/4DV506.sm222cf.PA1/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar
- install the [ANSI Escape in Console](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ansi-escape-console#group-details) plugin for Eclipse to see the console outputs in color. otherwise you might see nonsense charachters at the begining and end of each line.
